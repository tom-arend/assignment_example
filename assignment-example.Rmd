## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### 

```{r cars}
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```

###

Change

```{r}
y <- mean(10, 20, 100)
```
